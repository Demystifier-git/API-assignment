## 📝 API Specification

### Endpoint


GET /api/classify-number?number={number}


### Success Response (200 OK)


json
{
"number": 371,
"is_prime": false,
"is_perfect": false,
"properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
"digit_sum": 11,
"fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}

cargo test



## 📝 API Properties Combinations

The `properties` field in the response can have the following combinations:
- `["armstrong", "odd"]` - for Armstrong numbers that are odd
- `["armstrong", "even"]` - for Armstrong numbers that are even
- `["odd"]` - for non-Armstrong numbers that are odd
- `["even"]` - for non-Armstrong numbers that are even
